Hello Friends and Neighbors!!

I'm a long time consultant and contractor for ISPs, designing and deploying unix/linux systems.  This is my first repo at GitHub.


Here are some changes that I would like to insert... 

# This is the top, with a header

  * This is a list item
  * Here is another list item

# Header 1
* With a sort of list
    * With a **second** item

## Header 2
* With a sort of list
    * With a ~~second~~ item

1. A numbered list is always nice
2. You can never have enough of those
3.  But what would you say
4. If you had nothing but a rose

> This is a simple quote

And how about some code

```
sub showip($) {
    my $var = shift;
    my $ip = get_ip_info($var);
    print ("I found this IP => $ip\n");
}
```
